I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [http://verifiablerobotics.com/ Verifiable Robotics Research Group] in [http://www.mae.cornell.edu Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering] at [http://www.cornell.edu Cornell University].  I am advised by [http://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae/people/profile.cfm?netid=hk478 Prof. Hadas Kress-Gazit].  I am interested in the synthesis of provably-correct controllers for dynamical systems and the automatic discovery of specification revisions for guaranteeing execution in dynamic environments.  My work draws from a broad spectrum of ideas, including optimization, hybrid systems, formal methods, and control systems. 

Prior to Cornell and after receiving my B.S. and M.S. degrees at [http://www.vt.edu Virginia Tech], I spent several years in industry as an aerospace engineer at [http://www.nasa.gov NASA] and [http://www.impact-tek.com Impact Tech] (now Sikorsky).  While at NASA, I was part of the team that developed the software tool [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cdtb/software C-MAPSS], winner of a Space Act Award and a NASA Group Achievement Award.
