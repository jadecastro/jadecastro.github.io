I am a third-year Ph.D. Student in the [http://cornell-asl.org/ Autonomous Systems Laboratory] in the [http://www.mae.cornell.edu Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering] at [http://www.cornell.edu Cornell University].  My advisor is [http://www.verifiablerobotics.com Prof. Hadas Kress-Gazit].  I am interested in the synthesis of provably-correct controllers for complex robotic systems.  My work leverages from a broad spectrum of ideas, including optimization, formal methods, and control systems. 

Previous to my current position, I worked at [http://www.nasa.gov NASA] and [http://www.impact-tek.com Impact Tech] (now Sikorsky).
