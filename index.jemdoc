I am a third-year Ph.D. Student in the [http://cornell-asl.org/ Autonomous Systems Laboratory] in [http://www.mae.cornell.edu Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering] at [http://www.cornell.edu Cornell University].  My advisor is [http://www.verifiablerobotics.com Prof. Hadas Kress-Gazit].  I am interested in the synthesis of provably-correct controllers for complex robotic systems.  My work draws from a broad spectrum of ideas, including optimization, hybrid systems, formal methods, and control systems. 

Prior to Cornell and after receiving my B.S. and M.S. degrees at [http://www.vt.edu Virginia Tech], I spent several years in industry as an aerospace engineer at [http://www.nasa.gov NASA] and [http://www.impact-tek.com Impact Tech] (now Sikorsky).  While at NASA, I participated in the development of the software tool [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cdtb/software C-MAPSS].
